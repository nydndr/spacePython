## Acknowledgements
The Spaced Repetition technique is something preached over and over again by Ali Abdaal an excellent doctor, student and youtuber with great tips on how to do better in college and life.

The goal of this tool is to making my life easier when applying this principle and by mistake, maybe yours too.

### What I Learned In This Project
I wrote all this code after reading 6 chapters of Lean Python (Learn Just Enough Python For Building Useful Tools by Paul Gerrard) the first Python I've read, so basically I learned everything I know so far.

By this, I mean
- [X] Python syntax - and geez, it was hard
- [X] Input and ouput
- [X] Python modules
    - [X] Internals
    - [X] Externals
- [X] Python program structure
- [X] Datetime library
